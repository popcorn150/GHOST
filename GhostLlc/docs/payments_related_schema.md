## üß† Notes for Developers

- `autoReleaseAt` in Escrow is critical for timeout logic. Use a background job or scheduler to release funds if this time passes and no feedback has been received.
- Only escrows in the `buyer_confirmed` state should count toward available balance for sellers and become eligible for withdrawal.
- `paymentRef` in both Payments and Withdrawals should be used for reconciliation with Paystack or other gateways.
- Time fields (`createdAt`, `requestedAt`, etc.) are all in ISO 8601 format.
- All amounts are stored in **minor currency units** (e.g., `2500` NGN = ‚Ç¶25.00) to prevent floating-point errors.

## ‚úÖ Example Flow Summary

1. **Buyer pays ‚Üí** Payment record is created (`status: success`) ‚Üí Escrow is created with `status: awaiting_feedback`.
2. **Buyer responds:**
   - If happy ‚Üí `status: buyer_confirmed` ‚Üí Seller eligible for withdrawal.
   - If changes are needed ‚Üí `status: holding`.
   - No response ‚Üí check `autoReleaseAt`, and auto-release after timeout.
3. **Seller requests withdrawal** ‚Üí Creates a Withdrawal with `status: pending` ‚Üí Admin or system processes ‚Üí Status moves to `paid` or `failed`.
